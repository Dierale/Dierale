#### What I do in My Freetime

When I'm not at school or work you'll find me brushing up my coding with something fun, reading a good book, playing some strategy or roleplaying games, or traveling somewhere scenic and beautiful outdoors.

#### My Projects at the Moment

My biggest non-school related programming interests lie in game development and machine learning at the moment.  I'm in the idea stage for an MMORPG at the moment and its a pretty big project.<br>
I've got the foundations to the project started using the Unity engine, but its mostly about splitting the problem into smaller workable parts.<br>
I think the ideas and concepts involved with these parts will help me learn a lot of new things when I'm developing their modules.<br>
Machine learning and neural networks are very interesting to me, but until I get a better grasp on them I have no project to work on for them.
