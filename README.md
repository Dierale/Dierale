#### What I do in My Freetime

When I'm not at school or work you'll find me brushing up my coding with something fun, reading a good book, playing some strategy or roleplaying games, or traveling somewhere scenic and beautiful outdoors.  I'm currently interested in developing games using Unity & Godot in my free time.
